		<p>Before you begin anything, you will need the following things: hydraulic jack, jack stands, the correct new brakes, a socket set, and a flat area to work. All of these products can be bought at any auto parts store. To get the correct brakes, ask the worker at the desk and tell him your cars make, model, and year. It is important to note that rear and front brakes are different, so you will need to ask for the right ones. Front brakes are bigger and wear down much quicker than the rears. You will also need to remove the lid to your brake fluid in the engine bay to releave pressure. If you want better visuals, the video below will help you. </p>
