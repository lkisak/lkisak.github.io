			<p>The first step is to get your car up on jack stands. To do this, first get your hydraulic jack under the center jack point found in your ownerâ€™s manual or a quick google search. Also remember to put something behind a wheel of what ever side of the car you arent working on to ensure the car doesn't roll away. In the rear this can be the towing point or frame and in the front is typically somewhere on the subframe. (Picture 1) Jack this point high enough to where you can put your jack stands under the side jack points of the car. These are the little metal pieces with notches sticking down beside the wheel well. (Picture 2) Put the jack stands under those point so the car look like the picture (Picture 3). </p>
